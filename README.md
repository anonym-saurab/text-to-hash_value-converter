# text-to-hash_value-converter
Created a GUI based python program using tkinter for converting any text into its hash value. The texts will be converted into its hash value using the SHA256 algorithm. The hash value is irreversible i.e., once a text is converted into its hash value its impossible to convert back into its original text value.
